Modern computing : spatial, temporal and control locality

Different ways to 
-> Downsizing models

Factor decomposition - somthing like separable convolutional neural networks

value compression 
correlation based

parameter sharing, - reuse parameters


# Sparsification
Represent features as sparse vector
