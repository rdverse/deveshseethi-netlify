title: About me
---

I am a go-getter and I get things get things done. I enjoy getting engaged in challenging and open-ended problems to explore new paradigms of AI. I can quickly adapt to any environment and consume knowledge swiftly and apply to it to practical applications. My ability to  flexibility in learning as I come from a mix of computer science and electronics background. Moreover, my active research area involves leveraging AI algorithms for solving real-world problems in disease diagnostics and improving general public health. My reasearch so far showed me the importance of AI in the healthcare that motivated me to take up the challenge in improving the effeciency of existing deep learning models such as multimodal architectures involving vision, language, speech, and inertial sensors. Most importantly I am interested in optimizing the algorithms and fine-tune their performance to different hard ware resources in an attempt to make the solutions pervasive and bring a balance between pervasiveness and practicality.



Research Interests : 
PhD in computer science :
Advisor : [Dr. Pratool Bharti](https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/) 
My primary research includes leveraging AI to solve public health issues and build disease diagnostic models. I am currently working on building frameworks capable of detecting activity levels and behavioral patterns from cameras and subsequently using multimodal data from sensors and audio. My focus is mainly on computer vision and multimodal algorithms relating to panoptic segmentation, person re-identifaction, and point-of-interest tracking. The final outcome of the research is to build an effecient and optimized framework that healthcare facilities either small or large are able to leverage our proposed framework for extended periods with their hardware resources.

Masters in computer science :
My research during masters included building machine learning and neural network models that uses sensor-fusion to detect build optimized models for resource-constrained smartwatches.
