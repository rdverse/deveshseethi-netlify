Advisor : [Dr. Pratool Bharti](https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/)   

My primary research includes leveraging AI to solve public health issues and build disease diagnostic models. I am currently working on building frameworks capable of detecting activity levels and behavioral patterns from cameras and subsequently using multimodal data from sensors and audio. My focus is on computer vision and multimodal algorithms relating to panoptic segmentation, person re-identification, and point-of-interest tracking. The outcome of the research is to build an efficient and optimized framework that healthcare facilities, either small or large, can leverage our proposed framework for extended periods with their hardware resources. Last year, I developed an AI solution for COVID-19 testing using explainable-AI techniques that allow clinicians to understand the biomarkers that led to a particular diagnosis. Thus reinforcing trust in our AI model and providing scope to understand and debug the model when necessary, which is crucial in situations where the virus mutates dynamically. 
  

### Masters in Computer Science 
  
My research during my master's included building machine learning and neural network models that uses sensor fusion in several human activity recognition tasks. I also studied different ways to optimize models using quantization and pruning for resource-constrained smartwatches. During the start of my master's program, I mainly worked on several projects relating to NLP, focusing on understanding the strategies and information disseminated by bots in social media. 


### Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering   

I worked on several projects relating to the internet of things and embedded systems. I also interned at a defense research institution, where I learned how new embedded systems are tested and designed for integrating into systems at scale. I also got exposure to several professional organizations that are delineated in my Linkedin profile.
